Well, it's pretty much exactly what it sounds like. It's software that helps you translate text from one language to another. Think of it like having a bilingual friend who you can text whenever you come across a word or phrase you don't understand.\"}),`\n`,(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:`Now, I know what you might be thinking: \"But wait, don't we already have Google Translate?\" And yes, you're right! Google Translate is a great tool for quick and easy translations. But CATs are a bit different. They're specifically designed for professional translators and are much more powerful than your average online translator.`}),`\n`,(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:`One of the most important features of CATs is their ability to \"remember\" translations. So, if you're working on a big project and you keep coming across the same phrase over and over again, the CAT will remember how you translated it the first time and will automatically use the same translation for all future instances. This can save you a lot of time and make your translations much more consistent.`}),`\n`,(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:`Another great feature of CATs is their ability to work with \"translation memories.\" These are databases of previously translated text, which can be used to help speed up the translation process and ensure consistency. So, if you're translating a document and you come across a sentence that's already been translated before, the CAT will pull up the previous translation and suggest it to you. Pretty cool, right?`}),`\n`,(0,a.jsx)(n.p,{children:\"So, to sum it up, CATs are like having your own personal translator who never forgets anything and can access a vast library of translations. If you're a professional translator, they're an absolute must-have tool.
