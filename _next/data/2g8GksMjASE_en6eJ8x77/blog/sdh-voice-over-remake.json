In this case, there is no effective dubbing. The soundtrack of the target text is superimposed on the original soundtrack. The source language thus remains easily audible. The target text must be a little shorter than the original sound because the beginning and the end of the original sound must be easily audible. This method is often used for interviews, news reports, or documentaries.\nHowever, there is a special case. No effective dubbing is done for Slavic countries. In this case, voice-over is used.
