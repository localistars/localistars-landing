                  Doubling my 9–5 salary several times in my career is something
                  I never thought would happen. My career went from startup land
                  to call center operator in a short space of time.

                <Details.Text>
                  That meant going from six-figures down to the minimum wage in
                  my home country of Australia. And to top it off, I have no
                  degrees in anything business related — unless you count a
                  sound engineering qualification.

                  If an uneducated guy from the home of the Kangaroo can double
                  their salary, there is definitely hope for you. Popular career
                  websites like “Seek” suggest the typical advice about doing
                  better in your performance review or getting more education
                  from a university. This advice is out of date and I have
                  watched many colleagues fall for this trap and only end up
                  disappointed.

                  Doubling your salary, or at the very least increasing it
                  significantly, is about breaking the norm and trying a few
                  things that are a bit more radical as you’re about to see with
                  these simple tips below.

                  <Details.Text>
                    Okay so you can make more money but if that’s your only
                    goal, the extra zeroes on your bank balance will get really
                    boring real quick.
