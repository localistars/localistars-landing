i18n, or internationalization, is a critical aspect of software development that allows applications to adapt to different languages and cultural norms. However, despite its importance, there are still a number of misconceptions about i18n that persist in the tech community. In this article, we will take a humorous and satirical look at some of the most common myths and misconceptions about i18n. So put on your sarcastic hats and let's dive into the world of i18n!


## Myth 1: i18n Is Only Important for Multinational Companies

Many people believe that i18n is only relevant to large multinational corporations with customers around the world. This couldn't be further from the truth. In today's globalized world, even small businesses can benefit from i18n. By making your application available in multiple languages, you can expand your customer base and [increase your revenue](../grow-online-business). Who wouldn't want that?

## Myth 2: i18n Is Just Translation

Another common misconception about i18n is that it's just about translating text from one language to another. In fact, i18n is much more than that. It involves adapting user interfaces, date and time formats, and even cultural norms such as currency symbols and units of measurement. So if you thought i18n was just about running text through [Google Translate](https://locize.com/blog/google-translate-accuracy/), think again!

## Myth 3: i18n Is Too Expensive and Time-Consuming

Some developers believe that implementing i18n in their application is too expensive and time-consuming. Sure, it may take some extra effort up front, but the benefits far outweigh the costs. By making your application available to users around the world, you can reach new markets and increase your profits. And with [translation management software](../i18n-l10n-t9n-tms/) tools, like [locize](https://locize.com), implementing i18n has never been easier or more affordable.

## Myth 4: i18n Is Only Relevant to Certain Industries

Some people believe that i18n is only relevant to certain industries, such as e-commerce or travel. This could not be further from the truth. Virtually any type of application can benefit from i18n, from social media platforms to video games. After all, everyone deserves to be able to use an application in their own language and according to their own cultural norms. [Play the game](https://locize.com/blog/is-your-software-ready-for-localization/) and try to make your application ready for localization!

## Myth 5: i18n Is Only Relevant to Non-English Languages

Finally, some people believe that i18n is only relevant to non-English languages. In fact, i18n is just as important for English-language applications. After all, English is not the [native language of everyone](../grow-online-business) who uses it. And different English-speaking countries have their own cultural norms and inguistic quirks. By implementing i18n, you can ensure that your application is accessible to all English-speaking users, regardless of where they're from.
