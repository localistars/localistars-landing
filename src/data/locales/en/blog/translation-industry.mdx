## Trends in the translation industry
<br />

### Marketers & AI

The translation sector overcame recent problems and shown development. Growth is also anticipated in the following years. 

Above all, open source tools will stifle market growth. On the other hand, many marketers see the need of investing in localization. Many are even convinced that they are investing much too little. 

Machine translation will continue to drive technological advancement and, more crucially, will occupy post-editing services tasks. The AI-translated text is passed on to a translation agency or translator for final processing. 

Communication and process structure will be important considerations. Because post-editing introduces an entirely new interface to the business.

Therefore, the good news for translators who are concerned that technology could one day replace human translators is that only sections of the translation task can now be automated.

### The rise of e-learning

The industry will benefit greatly from e-learning services, which will gain prominence during COVID-19 and will continue to do so. 

One of the best things about e-learning technologies is that everyone, no matter where they are, may access your information.
