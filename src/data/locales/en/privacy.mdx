### 3 PERSONAL INFORMATION THAT localistars COLLECTS AND WHY WE COLLECT IT

Our data processing has various purposes. In principle, we use the data within the scope of customer contact and the fulfilment of the contract, the provision of our offer and the improvement of our online services. Data may also be used for marketing and communication purposes (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b and f GDPR).

#### 3.1 [localistars.com](https://localistars.com) the website and the subdomains

This website collects and uses personal information for the following reasons:

Like most websites, this site uses Google Analytics (GA) to track user interaction. We use this data to determine the number of people using our site, to better understand how they find and use our web pages and to see their journey through the website.

We consider Google Analytics to be a third party data processor (see section 6 below).

The website is hosted on [github pages](https://pages.github.com/).

We use [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy) as CDN and DNS provider, because of this they may track the website to detect and prevent attacks.

#### 3.2 Contact forms and email links

Should you choose to contact us using a contact form on one of our pages or an email link like [this one "support@localistars.com"](mailto:support@localistars.com), none of the data that you supply will be stored by localistars or passed to be processed by any of the third party data processors defined in section 6.0\. Instead the data will be collated into an email and sent to us over the [Simple Mail Transfer Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol) (SMTP). Our SMTP servers are protected by [TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) (sometimes known as SSL) meaning that the email content is encrypted using [SHA-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2), 256-bit cryptography before being sent across the internet. The email content is then decrypted by our local computers and devices.

#### 3.3 [localistars.app](http://localistars.app) our online platform service

### 4 HOW WE STORE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

As detailed in section 3.3 above, if you signup to our service the personal information as listed above in section 3 will be stored within our database. This is currently the only occasion where personal data will be stored on localistars. This data is stored in an unidentifiable fashion, the storage of this data is done in a pseudonymous fashion meaning that the data would require additional processing using a separately stored ‘key’ before it could be used to identify an individual.

If not stated differently in section 3 and subsections we try to use pseudonymisation for all personal data stored.

We use Amazon Web Services to store all data.

Your personal data will be deleted as soon as it is not anymore necessary for the purposes mentioned in section 3.1.

### 5 ABOUT THIS SERVICE’S SERVER

All traffic (transferral of files) between localistars services and your browser is encrypted and delivered over [HTTPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS).

If not stated differently in section 3 and subsections our services are hosted by Amazon (AWS), who employ their own security measures. AWS employs industry-recognized certifications and audits:

*   PCI DSS Level 1
*   ISO 27001
*   FISMA Moderate
*   HIPAA
*   SAS 70 Type II

The purpose of processing data is that Amazon enables us to use Amazon servers. We only store the data for as long as is necessary to achieve this purpose.

localistars and thus your data are hosted in Ireland by Amazon Web Services Inc., 410 Terry Avenue North, Seattle WA 98109, United States. Amazon also adopts stringent technical measures to protect your personal data. Amazon does not pass on your personal data to third parties unless this is necessary in order to perform the agreed services or if Amazon is required to do so by law or to comply with a valid and mandatory instruction issued by a government or regulatory authority. The data provided for this purpose are kept to a minimum.

In some circumstances, Amazon may also store the information in countries outside the European Economic Area. Amazon will, however, take the necessary steps to ensure that an appropriate level of data protection is maintained. If Amazon sends your data to the United States, for example, additional measures are taken, such as concluding EU-compliant data transmission agreements with the data importer if this is necessary. Amazon participates in the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework.

More information from Amazon about data protection is available at: [https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/eu-data-protection](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/eu-data-protection).

Their services and data centers have multiple layers of operational and physical security to ensure the integrity and safety of your data. You can read more about AWS security [here](https://aws.amazon.com/security/).
