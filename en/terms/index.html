If a Creator uses subcontractors or employees, Creator further agrees and acknowledges that this paragraph applies to localistars’s relationship, if any, with Creator’s subcontractors and employees as well and Creator is solely responsible for Creator’s subcontractors and employees.</p>
<p>Without limiting the foregoing paragraph, if you are an Agency or Agency Member, you expressly acknowledge, agree, and understand that: (1) the Agency is solely responsible for paying its Agency Members for work performed on behalf of the Agency and that such payments will not be made through the Site; (2) localistars is not a party to any agreement between the Agency and its Agency Members and does not have any liability or obligations under or related to any such agreement, even if the Agency or Agency Member defaults; (3) neither Agencies nor Agency Members are employees or agents of localistars; (4) localistars does not, in any way, supervise, direct, or control the Agency or Agency Members; (5) localistars does not set Agencies’ or Agency Members’ contract terms amongst themselves or with Consumers (including determining whether the contract will be hourly or fixed price), fees, pricing, work hours, work schedules, or location of work; (6) localistars does not provide Agencies or Agency Members with training or any equipment, labor, tools, or materials needed for any Service Contract; (7) localistars does not provide the premises at which the Agency or Agency Members will perform the work; and (8) localistars makes no representations as to the reliability, capability, or qualifications of any Agency or Agency Member or the ability or willingness of any Agency to make payments to or fulfill any other obligations to Agency Members, and localistars disclaims any and all liability relating thereto.</p>

<h4 id="72-taxes-and-benefits"><a class="anchor" href="#72-taxes-and-benefits"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>7.2 Taxes and Benefits</h4>

<h3 id="8-contractual-relationship-between-consumer-and-creator"><a class="anchor" href="#8-contractual-relationship-between-consumer-and-creator"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>8 Contractual relationship between Consumer and Creator</h3>
<p>This section discusses the relationship you may decide to enter into with another User, including Service Contracts between Users, as detailed below.</p>
<h4 id="81-service-contracts"><a class="anchor" href="#81-service-contracts"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>8.1 Service Contracts</h4>
<p>If a Consumer and Creator decide to enter into a Service Contract, the Service Contract is a contractual relationship directly between the Consumer and Creator. Consumer and Creaetor have complete discretion both with regard to whether to enter into a Service Contract with each other and with regard to the terms of any Service Contract. You acknowledge, agree, and understand that localistars is not a party to any Service Contract, that the formation of a Service Contract between Users will not, under any circumstance, create an employment or other service relationship between localistars and any Creator or a partnership or joint venture between localistars and any User.</p>
<p>With respect to any Service Contract, Consumers and Creators may enter into any written agreements that they deem appropriate (e.g., confidentiality agreements, invention assignment agreements, assignment of rights, etc.) provided that any such agreements do not conflict with, narrow, or expand localistars’s rights and obligations under the Terms of Service, under the Terms of Service.</p>
<h4 id="82-confidential-information"><a class="anchor" href="#82-confidential-information"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>8.2 Confidential information</h4>
<p>Users may agree to any terms they deem appropriate with respect to confidentiality. If and to the extent that the Users do not articulate any different agreement, then they agree that this Section 8.3 (Confidentiality) applies.</p>
<p>To the extent a User provides Confidential Information to the other, the recipient will protect the secrecy of the discloser’s Confidential Information with the same degree of care as it uses to protect its own Confidential Information, but in no event with less than due care. On a User’s written request, the party that received Confidential Information will promptly destroy or return the disclosing party’s Confidential Information and any copies thereof contained in or on its premises, systems, or any other equipment otherwise under its control.</p>
<h4 id="83-third-party-beneficiaries"><a class="anchor" href="#83-third-party-beneficiaries"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>8.3 Third-party beneficiaries</h4>
<p>It is the intent of the Parties to this Agreement that Users who have entered into Service Contracts or disclosed or received Confidential Information to another User are third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement with respect to this Section 8 only.</p>
<h4 id="9-no-qualification-as-worker"><a class="anchor" href="#9-no-qualification-as-worker"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>9 No qualification as worker</h4>
<p>Nothing in this Agreement is intended to or should be construed to create a partnership, joint venture, franchisor/franchisee or employer-employee relationship between localistars and a User.</p>
<p>Consumer is solely responsible for and has complete discretion with regard to selection of any Creator for any Project. Consumer is solely responsible, warrants its decisions regarding classification are correct, and assumes all liability, for determining whether Creators should be engaged as independent contractors or employees of Consumer and engaging them accordingly; localistars will have no input into, or involvement in, worker classification as between Consumer and Creator and Users agree that localistars has no involvement in and will have no liability arising from or relating to the classification of a Creator generally or with regard to a particular Project.</p>
<h3 id="10-localistars-fees"><a class="anchor" href="#10-localistars-fees"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>10 localistars fees</h3>
<p>This section describes what fees you agree to pay to localistars in exchange for localistars providing the Site and Site Services to you and what taxes localistars may collect, as detailed below.</p>
<h4 id="101-service-fees-for-creators"><a class="anchor" href="#101-service-fees-for-creators"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>10.1 Service fees for Creators</h4>
<p>Creators pay localistars a Service Fee for the use of the Site Services. localistars charges service fees to Creators, for using the Site Services, including the communication, invoicing, reporting and payment services, etc.
The Service Fees (to use the Site Services) are paid solely by Creators. When a Consumer pays a Creator for a Project or when funds related to a Project are otherwise released to a Creator, localistars will credit the Creator Account for the full amount paid or released by the Consumer, and then subtract and disburse to localistars the Service Fee. Creator hereby irrevocably authorizes and instructs localistars to deduct the Service Fee from the Creator Account and pay localistars on Creator’s behalf. In the event the Creator chooses to withdraw funds, there may also be a currency conversion charge imposed by localistars or an affiliate and the rate may differ from rates that are in effect on the date of the payment and you may be able to obtain a better rate from your bank or financial institution.
In addition to fees charged by localistars, your disbursement method may also charge activation, maintenance, or other account fees.</p>
<h4 id="102-vat-and-other-taxes"><a class="anchor" href="#102-vat-and-other-taxes"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>10.2 VAT and other taxes</h4>
<p>localistars may be required by applicable law to collect taxes or levies including, without limitation, withholding income tax or VAT (while some countries may refer to VAT using other terms, e.g. GST, we’ll just refer to VAT, GST and any local sales taxes collectively as “VAT”) in the jurisdiction of the Freelancer (the &quot;Taxes&quot;). In such instances, any amounts localistars is required to collect or withhold for the payment of any such Taxes shall be collected in addition to the fees owed to localistars under the Terms of Service.</p>
<h3 id="11-non-circumvention"><a class="anchor" href="#11-non-circumvention"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>11 Non-Circumvention</h3>
<p>This section discusses your agreement to make and receive payments only through localistars for two years from the date you first meet your Consumer or Creator on the Site, unless you pay an Opt-Out-Fee, as detailed below.</p>
<h4 id="111-making-payments-through-localistars"><a class="anchor" href="#111-making-payments-through-localistars"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>11.1 Making payments through localistars</h4>
<p>You acknowledge and agree that a substantial portion of the compensation localistars receives for making the Site available to you is collected through the Service Fee described in Section 10.1. localistars only receives this Service Fee when a Consumer and a Creator pay and receive payment through the Site. Therefore, for 24 months from the time you identify or are identified by any party through the Site (the “Non-Circumvention Period”), you agree to use the Site as your exclusive method to request, make, and receive all payments for work directly or indirectly with that party or arising out of your relationship with that party (the localistars Relationship”). For the avoidance of doubt, if you, or the business you represent, did not identify and were not identified by another party through the Site, such as if you and another User worked together before meeting on the Site, then the Non-Circumvention Period does not apply. If you use the Site as an employee, agent, or representative of another business, then the Non-Circumvention Period applies to you and other employees, agents, or representatives of the business when acting in that capacity with respect to the other User.</p>
<p>Except if you pay the Opt-Out Fee (see Section 11.2), you agree not to circumvent the Payment Methods offered by the Site. By way of illustration and not in limitation of the foregoing, you agree not to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Submit proposals or solicit parties identified through the Site to contract, hire, work with, or pay outside the Site.</li>
<li>Accept proposals or solicit parties identified through the Site to contract, invoice, or receive payment outside the Site.</li>
<li>Invoice or report on the Site or in an Opt-Out Fee request an invoice or payment amount lower than that actually agreed between Users.</li>
<li>Refer a User you identified on the Site to a third-party who is not a User of the Site for purposes of making or receiving payments off the Site.</li>
</ul>
<p>You agree to notify localistars immediately if a person suggests to you making or receiving payments outside of the Site in violation of this Section 11.1. If you are aware of a breach or potential breach of this non-circumvention agreement, please submit a confidential report to localistars by sending an email message to: <a href="mailto:support@localistars.com">support@localistars.com</a>.</p>
<p>If you refuse to accept any new version of the Terms of Service or elect not to comply with certain conditions of using the Site, such as minimum rates supported on the Site, and therefore choose to cease using the Site, you may pay the Opt-Out Fee for each other User you wish to continue working with on whatever terms you agree after you cease using the Site.</p>
<h4 id="112-opting-out"><a class="anchor" href="#112-opting-out"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>11.2 Opting out</h4>
<p>You may opt-out of the obligation in Section 11.1 with respect to each localistars Relationship only if the Consumer or prospective Consumer or Creator pays localistars an opt-out fee for each such relationship (the “Opt-Out Fee”).</p>
<p>The Opt-Out Fee is computed as follows:</p>
<p>(a) interest at the rate of 18% per annum or the maximum rate permitted by applicable law, whichever is less, on the amount calculated in (b), from the date Consumer first makes payment to the subject Creator until the date the Opt-Out Fee is paid; and</p>
<p>(b) the greater of:</p>
<p>(i) $3,500; or</p>
<p>(ii) 25% of the anticipated annualized salary or wages for one year if the Consumer offers Creator employment directly; or</p>
<p>(iii) all Service Fees that would be earned by localistars from the localistars Relationship during the Non-Circumvention Period, computed based on the annualized amount earned by Creator from Consumer during the most recent normalized 8-week period, or during such shorter period as data is available to localistars;</p>
<p>(iv) provided, however, that if the amount in (ii) and (iii) cannot be ascertained due to uncertainty or lack of sufficient information, then localistars and you agree that fee shall be USD $3,500; if only one of (ii) or (iii) can be ascertained, then localistars and you agree that amount shall be used if it is greater than USD $3,500.</p>
<p>To pay the Opt-Out Fee, you must request instructions by sending an email message to <a href="mailto:support@localistars.com">support@localistars.com</a>.</p>
<p>If localistars determines, in its sole discretion, that you have violated Section 11, localistars or its Affiliates may, to the maximum extent permitted by law (x) charge your Payment Method the Opt-Out Fee (including interest) if permitted by law or send you an invoice for the Opt-Out Fee (including interest), which you agree to pay within 30 days, (y) close your Account and revoke your authorization to use the Site and Site Services, and/or (z) charge you for all losses and costs (including any and all time of localistars’s employees) and reasonable expenses (including attorneys’ fees) related to investigating such breach and collecting such fees.</p>
